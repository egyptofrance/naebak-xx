# Current State Analysis - Naebak Platform

## What Exists Currently

### 1. User Pages Structure

#### `/user` - General User Pages
- `/user/settings` - Account settings
- `/user/settings/security` - Security settings
- `/user/settings/developer` - API keys
- `/user/invitations` - Workspace invitations
- `/user/notifications` - Notifications

#### `/user` - Deputy-Specific Pages (Already Built!)
- ✅ `/user/deputy-data` - Deputy basic data management
- ✅ `/user/electoral-program` - Electoral program management
- ✅ `/user/achievements` - Achievements management
- ✅ `/user/events` - Events management

### 2. Server Actions

#### Admin Actions (`src/data/admin/`)
- `deputies.ts` - Admin CRUD for deputies
- `deputy-content.tsx` - Admin management of deputy content (electoral programs, achievements, events)
- `user.tsx` - Admin user management

#### User Actions (`src/data/user/`)
- `deputy-self-management.ts` - **NEW** Deputy self-management actions (just created)

### 3. Sidebar Structure

#### Current Sidebar (`/user/@sidebar/user-sidebar.tsx`)
```tsx
<SidebarContent>
  <SidebarAdminPanelNav />  // Shows for admins only
  <Suspense>
    <SidebarDeputyNav />     // Should show for deputies
  </Suspense>
  <Suspense>
    <SoloWorkspaceTips />
  </Suspense>
</SidebarContent>
```

#### SidebarDeputyNav Component
- Links to: deputy-data, electoral-program, achievements, events
- **Problem**: Not showing for deputies (returns null)

### 4. Database Tables

- `deputy_profiles` - Deputy basic information
- `deputy_electoral_programs` - Electoral program items
- `deputy_achievements` - Achievement items
- `deputy_events` - Event items
- `user_roles` - User role assignments
- `manager_permissions` - Manager permissions

## The Real Problem

**Deputies can't see their sidebar sections!**

### Root Cause
`getDeputyProfile()` returns `null` even when deputy data exists in database.

### Why?
Unknown - need to check console logs from actual deputy login.

## What Was Already Built (That I Didn't Know!)

1. ✅ Deputy pages exist in `/user/deputy-data`, `/user/electoral-program`, etc.
2. ✅ `DeputyDataForm` component exists
3. ✅ `ElectoralProgramManager` component exists
4. ✅ `AchievementsManager` component exists
5. ✅ `EventsManager` component exists
6. ✅ Admin can manage all deputy content from `/app_admin/deputies`

## What's Missing

1. ❌ Deputy self-management server actions (partially added now)
2. ❌ Deputy sidebar not showing
3. ❌ Deputy pages use admin actions instead of user actions

## The Correct Solution

### Step 1: Fix Sidebar Visibility (PRIORITY)
- Debug why `getDeputyProfile()` returns null
- Check console logs from deputy login
- Fix the query or caching issue

### Step 2: Enable Deputy Self-Management
- Create user-level server actions for deputies
- Allow deputies to edit their own:
  - Basic data (deputy_profiles)
  - Electoral programs (deputy_electoral_programs)
  - Achievements (deputy_achievements)
  - Events (deputy_events)

### Step 3: Update Forms
- Update `DeputyDataForm` to use user actions (DONE)
- Update `ElectoralProgramManager` to check if user is deputy
- Update `AchievementsManager` to check if user is deputy
- Update `EventsManager` to check if user is deputy

## Template Capabilities (Nextbase)

## Next Steps (Clear Plan)

1. **Fix Sidebar** (30 min)
   - Get console logs from deputy login
   - Fix `getDeputyProfile()` query
   - Test sidebar appears

2. **Enable Deputy Editing** (2 hours)
   - Create user-level server actions for all deputy content
   - Update all manager components to use user actions when user is deputy
   - Test deputy can edit their own data

3. **Test Everything** (1 hour)
   - Test deputy login
   - Test deputy can see sidebar
   - Test deputy can edit all their data
   - Test admin can still manage deputies

## Current Commit Status

- Latest commit: `187daf0` - debug logging added
- Deployment: Waiting for testing
- Need: Console logs from deputy login to debug sidebar issue
