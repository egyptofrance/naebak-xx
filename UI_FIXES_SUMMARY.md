# UI Fixes Summary - October 21, 2025

## Overview
This update addresses three key issues in the Naebak platform:
1. Removed "Resources" section from admin sidebar
2. Fixed delete UI refresh issues
3. Fixed new deputy sidebar visibility problems

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Resources Section from Admin Sidebar

**File Modified:** `src/app/[locale]/(dynamic-pages)/(authenticated-pages)/app_admin/(admin-pages)/@sidebar/application-admin-sidebar.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed import of `SidebarPlatformNav` component
- Removed `<SidebarPlatformNav />` from sidebar content
- This removes the "Resources" section containing Documentation, Community, Changelog, and Roadmap links

### 2. Fixed Delete UI Refresh Issues

Added `revalidatePath()` calls to all delete server actions to automatically refresh the UI after deletion.

**Files Modified:**

#### `src/data/admin/user.tsx`
- Added `revalidatePath` import from `next/cache`
- Added `revalidatePath('/app_admin/users')` to:
  - `deleteUserAction` - after deleting a single user
  - `deleteMultipleUsersAction` - after deleting multiple users (both success and partial success)

#### `src/data/admin/deputies.ts`
- Added `revalidatePath` import from `next/cache`
- Added `revalidatePath('/app_admin/deputies')` to:
  - `deleteDeputyAction` - after deleting a single deputy
  - `bulkDeleteDeputiesAction` - after bulk deleting deputies

#### `src/data/admin/managers.ts`
- Added `revalidatePath` import from `next/cache`
- Added `revalidatePath('/app_admin/managers')` to:
  - `deleteManagerAction` - after deleting a single manager
  - `bulkDeleteManagersAction` - after bulk deleting managers

### 3. Fixed New Deputy Sidebar Visibility Issue

**Root Cause:** The `getCachedDeputyProfile` function uses Next.js's `unstable_cache` with a 60-second cache duration. When a new deputy was created, the cache wasn't invalidated, so the new deputy wouldn't see the sidebar sections until the cache expired.

**Solution:** Added `revalidateTag('deputy-profile')` to invalidate the cache immediately when deputy status changes.

**File Modified:** `src/data/admin/deputies.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `revalidateTag` import from `next/cache`
- Added `revalidateTag('deputy-profile')` to:
  - `createDeputyAction` - after creating a new deputy profile
  - `deleteDeputyAction` - after deleting a deputy
  - `bulkDeleteDeputiesAction` - after bulk deleting deputies

This ensures that when a citizen is promoted to deputy, they will immediately see the deputy-specific sidebar sections:
- البيانات الإضافية (Additional Data)
- البرنامج الانتخابي (Electoral Program)
- الإنجازات (Achievements)
- المناسبات (Events)

## Expected Results

1. **Admin Sidebar:** The "Resources" section is no longer visible in the admin panel
2. **Delete Operations:** After deleting users, deputies, or managers, the list automatically refreshes without requiring manual page reload
3. **New Deputies:** When a citizen is promoted to deputy, they immediately see all deputy-specific sidebar sections without having to wait or refresh

## Testing Notes

- Local testing was not possible due to sandbox space limitations
- All changes are syntactically correct and follow Next.js best practices
- Changes will be tested in production environment after deployment to Vercel

3. `src/data/admin/deputies.ts`
